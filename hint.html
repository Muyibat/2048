        <h1>How to Play 2048</h1>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          Your goal in 2048 is to combine numbered tiles on the grid to reach
          the tile labeled 2048 (or higher if you're feeling competitive!).
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay Steps</h2>

        <h3>Starting the Game</h3>
        <p>
          When you begin, you'll see a 4x4 grid with two tiles already placed on
          the board, usually with the numbers 2 or 4. These numbers will
          increase as you combine tiles.
        </p>

        <h3>Moving Tiles</h3>
        <p>
          Use the arrow keys on your keyboard (or swipe on mobile) to move the
          tiles in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right.
        </p>
        <h4>When you move the tiles:</h4>

        <p>
          All tiles on the grid will shift in the direction you chose. New tiles
          (usually a 2 or 4) will appear in an empty space on the board after
          every move.
        </p>
        <h3>Merging Tiles</h3>

        <p>
          If two tiles with the same number touch, they combine into a single
          tile with double the value. For example, if you move two 2 tiles
          together, they’ll merge into a 4 tile. Continue merging tiles to
          create higher numbers. The larger the number, the closer you are to
          winning!
        </p>
        <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>Plan ahead:</strong> Each move adds a new tile, so be careful
          not to fill up the board too quickly. If the grid becomes full and
          there are no more moves left, you'll lose.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Think about merging wisely:</strong> Try to keep higher-value
          tiles together in a corner or along one side, which will make it
          easier to merge them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Keep the grid organized:</strong> Avoid spreading out tiles
          too much. Merging tiles strategically will create larger numbers more
          efficiently.
        </p>

        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>

        <p>
          When you create a tile with the number 2048, you win! But the game
          doesn't have to stop there—you can continueplaying to reach even
          higher numbers, such as 4096 or more.
        </p>
        <h2>Losing the Game</h2>

        <p>
          If the grid is completely filled with tiles, and there are no more
          moves left (i.e., no adjacent tiles with the same number), the game is
          over.
        </p>
        <h2>Good Luck! Have fun playing, and remember: every move counts!</h2>
